Will try to eventually post some stuff here about my emulators. 

Working on CryDS, a NDS emulator. Progress is not looking the best for now. I've gotten some basic roms to run (TinyFB, hello_rgb and my own made redpanda rom), but armwrestler doesn't seem to copy any main code to ram :/ Let's see, maybe I'll track the bug down one day!

I'm also planning to write some more basic NDS roms for testing, will also release them in the cryds repo, stay tuned!
